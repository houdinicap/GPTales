## How It Works

Each story is represented by a markdown file under `_posts`. The genre of the story is set using the `genre` field in the front matter of the markdown file. The list of available genres is derived from the markdown files under `_genres`. Each genre is represented by a markdown file with a `name` field in the front matter.

When you navigate to the home page of the site, it lists all genres and their respective stories.

To add a new story, create a new markdown file under `_posts` with the appropriate `genre` set in the front matter. If you are adding a story in a new genre, remember to create a new markdown file for that genre under `_genres`.
